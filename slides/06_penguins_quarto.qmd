## Data

```{r}
#| include: false

library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
```

For this analysis, we will use the **penguins** data set from the palmerpenguins package. The website belonging to this package can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

The data set contains size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for three penguins species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica, over a study period of three years [@gorman2014].

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguins
#| fig-cap: A scatter plot of flipper length against body mass
#| warning: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
```

@fig-penguins shows a scatter plot of the flipper length against the body mass of all penguins in the data set.

The data set comprises measurements of three types of penguins, namely:

-   Adelie 🐧

-   Chinstrap 🐧

-   Gentoo 🐧
