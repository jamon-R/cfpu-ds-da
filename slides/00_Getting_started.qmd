# Course design

## Welcome to Data Science and Data Analytics!

-   This is **B-GV-12 Data Science and Data Analytics**.
-   The goal of this course is to teach you...
    -   about the nature and role of data science in a data-driven world.
    -   about the data science workflow.
    -   to use open-source software to analyse, visualize and model data from various sources.
    -   about different machine learning algorithms.
    -   to implement your own data science projects.
    -   to communicate the results of your analyses effectively.
    -   and much more...

## Lectures

-   With a few exceptions, lectures will be held on **Fridays from 13:30 to 16:30**.
-   Please regularly check your course schedule to not miss any lectures.
-   Lectures will consist of theory and practice discussed with the help of **slides** as well as **live coding sessions**.
-   You are highly encouraged to **actively participate**!
-   Exercises to practice what you have learned will be provided (but not graded).

## Grading

-   There will be **no** final exam in this course!
-   Instead, grading will be based on **group projects**:
    -   Teams of 4 - 5 students will initiate and design a small data science project autonomously.
    -   Each group will:
        -   identify a business case mimicking a real-world research problem and an accompanying available data set.
        -   formulate research questions on the basis of the chosen data set.
        -   perform analyses using the concepts and methods learned throughout this course.

## Grading

-   Grading will therefore be based on the following components:
    -   **Group project report** (5-10 pages per group member): **65 %**
    -   **Group presentation** ($\leq$ 20 mins/group and $\geq$ 2 mins/group member): **25 %**
    -   **Peer review: 10 %**
-   In line with the usual grading scheme, grades will be given as follows:

:::::: columns
::: {.small .column width="25%"}
:::

::: {.small .column width="30%"}
| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|------:|
| 95 - 100 % |   1,0 |
| 90 - 94 %  |   1,3 |
| 85 - 89 %  |   1,7 |
| 80 - 84 %  |   2,0 |
| 75 - 79 %  |   2,3 |
| 70 - 74 %  |   2,7 |
:::

::: {.small .column width="30%"}
| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|------:|
| 65 - 69 %  |   3,0 |
| 60 - 64 %  |   3,3 |
| 55 - 59 %  |   3,7 |
| 50 - 54 %  |   4,0 |
| below 50 % |   5,0 |

## Grading: Group project

-   The **structure** of the group project (reflected in report and presentation) should be something like this:
    -   Introduction / Motivation and research question
    -   Data (sources, description, statistics, visualizations, ...)
    -   Models and model evaluation
    -   Results
    -   Discussion and comments
-   Aspects that will influence your grade will be: the originality of the question, understanding of the business case, data and methods, correctness of application, thoroughness of evaluation, creativity and quality of report and presentation (both verbal and visual)
-   Deductions will be made for purely AI-generated contributions.

## Grading: Group project

::::: columns
::: {.slightlysmall .column width="50%"}
**Choice of topic**: while you are completely free in your choice of topic in the group, here are some areas of suggestion:

-   Finance / Economics / Marketing
-   Text analysis
-   Entertainment (in particular: movies and music)
-   Social network analysis
-   Social sciences
:::

::: {.slightlysmall .column width="50%"}
**Sources for data sets**: while you are again free also in your choice of data set, good places to get you started are:

-   [Statistik Austria](https://www.statistik.at/services/tools/services/opendata)
-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
-   [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
-   [World bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/home)
-   [EU](https://data.europa.eu/en)
-   ...

. . .

::: callout-caution
When selecting a data set, make sure, you are **allowed** to use this data for the purposes of your project! When selecting from the sources given, this should generally be ensured.
:::

## Grading: Peer review

::: slightlysmall
-   After final project presentations, each **individual** student will be asked to write a **peer review** of one of the other groups' projects.
-   Each student will be randomly assigned **two projects**, out of which **one** should be reviewed (based on their presentation only).
-   Evaluation is based on the **quality of review** that you write, not on the feedback that your project receives.
-   The review should be **max 250 words** answering the following questions:
    -   Briefly describe the topic, research questions and the employed methods.
    -   State and briefly explain two positive comments about the work.
    -   State and briefly explain two improvement suggestions.
:::

. . .

::: callout-important
In your peer review, focus on **content**, not on the formatting or quality of the slides, for instance.

## Software

-   Modern data science is unthinkable without **computer programming**: typically, either [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is used.
-   For the purposes of this course, we will use:
    -   The open-source statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
    -   A bespoke integrated development environment (IDE) for R called [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).
    -   An authoring framework for creating beautiful reports, presentations, web sites, etc., combining text, code, results and visualizations, called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
-   Until next time, therefore please
    -   either **install** R, RStudio and Quarto on your laptop (recommended) or
    -   register for a free account at [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/).

## Resources

-   **Primarily**: slides and exercises provided
-   However, for a deeper dive and additional materials, I recommend:

## Resources -- How about AI?

::: incremental
-   With the large-scale adoption of AI tools like **ChatGPT**, the way data scientists work is rapidly changing.
-   This course therefore **actively encourages** the use of AI tools for R programming. Here are some guidelines:
    -   Use ChatGPT for **programming**, not for writing the project report.
    -   Do **not** just copy-paste code generated by ChatGPT. Run it line-by-line, try to understand and edit as needed.
    -   Engineer your prompts until the response starts to look like code you are learning in this course.
    -   If the response is not correct, ask for a correction.
-   With the arrival of AI, programming is becoming ever more **accessible**, but the need for people like you who actually **understand** the code they are running, is also increasing.
